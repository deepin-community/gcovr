https://reproducible\-builds.org/docs/source\-dateepoch) or current time. Config key(s): timestamp.
.SS "Filter Options:"
.IP
Filters decide which files are included in the report. Any filter must
match, and no exclude filter must match. A filter is a regular expression
that matches a path. Filter paths use forward slashes, even on Windows. If
the filter looks like an absolute path it is matched against an absolute
path. Otherwise, the filter is matched against a relative path, where that
path is relative to the current directory or if defined in a configuration
file to the directory of the file.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-filter\fR GCOV_FILTER
Keep only gcov data files that match this filter. Can
be specified multiple times. Config key(s): gcovfilter.
.TP

specified multiple times. Config key(s): gcov\-exclude.

multiple times. Config key(s): gcov\-excludedirectories, exclude\-directories.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR FILTER, \fB\-\-filter\fR FILTER
Keep only source files that match this filter. Can be
specified multiple times. Relative filters are
relative to the current working directory or if
defined in a configuration file. If no filters are
provided, defaults to \fB\-\-root\fR. Config key(s): filter.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR EXCLUDE, \fB\-\-exclude\fR EXCLUDE
Exclude source files that match this filter. Can be
specified multiple times. Config key(s): exclude.
.SS "GCOV Options:"
.IP
The 'gcov' tool turns raw coverage files (.gcda and .gcno) into .gcov
files that are then processed by gcovr. The gcno files are generated by
the compiler. The gcda files are generated when the instrumented program
is executed.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gcov\-use\-existing\-files\fR, \fB\-\-use\-gcov\-files\fR
Use existing gcov files for analysis. Config key(s):
gcov\-use\-existing\-files, use\-gcov\-files.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-ignore\-errors\fR [{all,source_not_found,output_error,no_working_dir_found}]
Ignore errors from invoking GCOV command instead of
exiting with an error. A report will be shown on
stderr. Default is 'None'. Config key(s): gcov\-ignoreerrors.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-ignore\-parse\-errors\fR [{all,negative_hits.warn,negative_hits.warn_once_per_file}]
Skip lines with parse errors in GCOV files instead of
exiting with an error. A report will be shown on
stderr. Default is 'None'. Config key(s): gcov\-ignoreparse\-errors.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-executable\fR GCOV_CMD
Use a particular gcov executable. Must match the
compiler you are using, e.g. 'llvm\-cov gcov' for
Clang. Can include additional arguments. Defaults to
the GCOV environment variable, or 'gcov': 'gcov'.
Config key(s): gcov\-executable.
.TP
\fB\-\-gcov\-object\-directory\fR GCOV_OBJDIR, \fB\-\-object\-directory\fR GCOV_OBJDIR
Override normal working directory detection. Gcovr
needs to identify the path between gcda files and the
directory where the compiler was originally run.
Normally, gcovr can guess correctly. This option
specifies either the path from gcc to the gcda file
(i.e. gcc's '\-o' option), or the path from the gcda
file to gcc's working directory. Config key(s): gcovobject\-directory, object\-directory.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-gcov\-keep\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR
Keep gcov files after processing. This applies both to
files that were generated by gcovr, or were supplied
via the \fB\-\-gcov\-use\-existing\-files\fR option. Config
key(s): keep\-gcov\-files.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-gcov\-delete\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
Delete gcda files after processing. Config key(s):
delete\-gcov\-files.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR [GCOV_PARALLEL]
Set the number of threads to use in parallel. Config
key(s): gcov\-parallel.
.TP
\fB\-\-merge\-mode\-functions\fR MERGE_MODE

gcov files for same sourcefile.Default is 'strict'.
Config key(s): merge\-mode\-functions.
.TP
\fB\-\-include\-internal\-functions\fR
Include function coverage of compiler internal
functions (starting with '__' or '_GLOBAL__sub_I_').
Config key(s): include\-internal\-functions.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-unreachable\-branches\fR
Exclude branch coverage from lines without useful
source code (often, compiler\-generated 'dead' code).
Config key(s): exclude\-unreachable\-branches.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-function\-lines\fR
Exclude coverage from lines defining a function.
Config key(s): exclude\-function\-lines.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-noncode\-lines\fR
Exclude coverage from lines which seem to be non\-code.
Negation: \fB\-\-no\-exclude\-noncode\-lines\fR. Config key(s):
exclude\-noncode\-lines.
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\-throw\-branches\fR
For branch coverage, exclude branches that the
compiler generates for exception handling. This often
leads to more 'sensible' coverage reports. Config
key(s): exclude\-throw\-branches.
